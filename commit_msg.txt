feat(auth): add role-aware login with temporary mock auth

- merge UI + login logic into `client/src/pages/Login.tsx`
- store `role` and `username` in localStorage for role checks
- add auth helpers in `client/src/utils/auth.ts` (isAdmin, isAuthenticated, logout, route guards)
- add simple mock users and `/api/login` stub for local testing
- show "ADMIN MODE" in `Dashboard` for admin users

Notes: mock auth is temporary â€” replace with real DB/JWT flow when backend is ready.
